LFCC-LCNN baseline for ASVspoof 2021

General
----------
baseline_LA: model and configuration files for LA baseline
baseline_PA: model and configuration files for PA baseline
baseline_DF: model and configuration files for DF baseline


Folder structure
----------------
Files marked with '=' are generated after running 02_toy_example.sh.

|- baseline_LA: folder for baseline LA
|  |  
|  |  |- 00_train.sh: recipe to train the model
|  |  |- 01_eval.sh: command line to evaluate the model on eval set
|  |  |- 02_eval_alternative.sh: convenient script used by 01_wrapper_eval.sh
|  |  |- main.py: main function
|  |  |- config.py: configuration file
|  |  |- config_auto.py: configuration file used by 02_eval_alternative.sh
|  |  |- model.py: definition of model in Pytorch code
|  |  |- __pretrained
|  |  |    |- trained_network.pt: pre-trained model
|  |  |
|  |  |= epochNNN.pt: trained model after NNN-th epoch
|  |  |= trained_network.pt: trained model after the full training process
|  |  |= asvspoof2021_*_toy_utt_length.dic: 
|  |  |    cache files to save the duration information of each trial
|  |  |    they are automatically generated by the code
|  |  |    they can be deleted freely
|  |  |
|  |  |= log_train.txt: training log
|  |  |= log_err.txt: error log (it also contains the training loss of each trial)
|  |  |= log_eval.txt: evaluation log
|  |  |= log_eval_score.txt: score of each trial, extracted from log_eval.txt
|  |  |= log_eval_err.txt: error log 

log_train.txt is self-explanable.

log_eval_score.txt has two columns (see Note 2):
  File_name score
  LA_E_1066571 1


Note
----------
1. If GPU memory is insufficient, please reduce --batch-size in */00_train.sh

2. Output score has this following format:

   File_name score
   LA_E_1066571 1

   A score of 1 equates to bona fide, while 0 is spoof.

3. Accordingly, the code assumes 0 and 1 as the target labels for spoof and bona fide
   trials, respectively. 

4. Although you can use an arbiary string to name the data set in config.py and
   02_eval_alternative.sh, it is better to use a meaningful name and differentiate 
   the names for different data sets. 
   For example, we use asvspoof2021_train_toy, asvspoof2021_val_toy, asvspoof2021_eval_toy
   in config.py.
     
5. The used countermeasure model is detailed here https://arxiv.org/abs/2103.11326.
   However, the LFCC front-end uses a slightly different configuration: the maximum frequency
   of the linear filter bank was set to 4kHz, not 8kHz.

That's all
